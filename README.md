# NYC Bike Sharing

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to show how successful the bike sharing program is in New York City and to determine if a similar program should be incorporated in Des Moines, IA.

I have included some screenshots of my data analysis, as well as provided a link to show all of my anlaysis in the Results section.

### Results
By looking at the data, we can see that most bikes are checked out between 7 to 9 am, and 5 to 7 pm on the weekdays (Monday through Friday). I would say these times represent a New Yorkers daily commute to and from work. This trend is also present when we look at the demand per hour in the month of August, with the highest number of trips being between 5 to 6 pm.  

There is also consistent usage during the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) between the hours 10 am to 6 pm, which could be because of tourist visiting the city on the weekends. The weekend hours do not have the same demand in specific hours of the day compared to the weekdays, but the trips are more spread out amongst the day. I wanted to see what the total of trips per Weekday was, and found that Sunday and Wednesday have the lowest number of trips, and Thursday through Saturday have the highest number. Thursday has the highest number of trips of any weekday and I would attribute this to having both commuters utilizing the bikes as well as tourist that fly in for a long weekend.

The data also shows us that trips are lasting less than 1 hour, with most trips being between 5 to 10 minutes. Trip duration tends to slightly and consistently increase as the age of riders decrease.

We can also see that the bike sharing program is highly dominated by male users, and the majority of the users are Subscribers.

### Summary 
Based on the data, it appears that the bike sharing program is very successful and widely used in New York City. Some things for future consideration would be to look at gender and geographical data for Des Moines, IA, as well as how many tourists the city gets. 

In order for this to be successful in another location, you would want to consider what percentage of the population is male, since the program is widely used by male subscribers and customers. I would also be interested in the geographical elements of Des Moines, IA and how long it may take to ride a bike from different attractions or office disctricts in the city. Since most trips lasted around 10 minutes, the program may not be as successful if the point of interst in Des Moines are spread out further than this time threshold. I would also like more information regarding customer vs. subscriber? Does a subscriber mean they have an annual, weekly, or daily membership to use the bikes? Are subscribers only local users? Are customers considered tourists and just using the bikes once while on vacation? It would be beneficial to understand this a little better to see if you wanted to look at tourism in Des Moines, or just focus on the permenant population of the city. 

Overall, I think the bike sharing program would be popular and worth the investment.
